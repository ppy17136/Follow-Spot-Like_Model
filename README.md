## üåü Overview

This repository provides all the **simulation codes, raw data, analysis scripts, and visualization tools** for the study described in our paper. We propose a **novel follow-spot-like model** that transforms dynamic dislocation motion into a quasi-static process, enabling high-precision and noise-free studies of dislocation dynamics‚Äîdemonstrated on <111> screw dislocations in B2-NiAl.

**Key features of our approach:**

* **Eliminates interference forces** in the simulation environment, leading to more accurate analysis of dislocation core evolution and motion.
* **Transforms dislocation dynamics** into a sequence of static problems, allowing use of static analysis tools and clearer insight into dislocation mechanisms.
* **Full reproducibility:** All simulation input files, LAMMPS scripts, Python analysis tools, and raw/processed data are included.

## ‚ú® Scientific Highlights

* **First-of-its-kind "follow-spot" model**: The dislocation line is always aligned with the axis of a cylindrical slab, which dynamically follows the motion of the dislocation‚Äîlike a spotlight tracking a performer.
* **Mapped dislocation energy surfaces** for <111> screw dislocations in B2-NiAl, revealing nontrivial energy valley positions due to the absence of simulation artifacts.
* **Revealed winding, non-linear dislocation trajectories** under applied <121> glide forces‚Äîcorrecting oversimplified assumptions of straight-line motion.
* **Discovered multiple core configurations**: compact, planar dissociation, and spatial dissociation. Found spatial dissociation is a likely key obstacle to <111> dislocation activation and plasticity in B2-NiAl.
* **Full validation on classical and machine-learning interatomic potentials** for both B2-NiAl and bcc-Fe.
